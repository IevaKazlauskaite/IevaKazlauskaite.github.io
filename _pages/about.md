I am a Biometrika Fellow at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. Prior to that, I was a Research Associate (postdoc) in the same Department funded by the <a href="https://iconicmath.org/" target="_blank">ICONIC</a> grant. I completed my doctoral degree at the University of Bath, UK in 2020 working on Gaussian processes. During my doctoral studies I spent 3 years in industry as a Research Engineer / Engineering Doctorate student at the Frostbite Physics Team at Electronic Arts, Guildford, UK.
