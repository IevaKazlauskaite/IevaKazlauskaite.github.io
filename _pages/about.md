I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics" target="_blank">Department of Statistics at LSE</a>, the London School of Economics and Political Science. 
<p>
<p>
  
In 2023-2024, I was a Senior Research Fellow in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science" target="_blank">Statistical Science at UCL</a>, supported by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-statistical-sciences/institute-mathematical-and-statistical-sciences" target="_blank">IMSS (the Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Sciences)</a>. Prior to that, I was a  Biometrika Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. I'm a visiting researcher at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) working with Scott Hosking in the <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/team/science-teams/ai-lab/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Lab</a> and Robert Arthern in the <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/team/science-teams/ice-and-past-climate/" target="_blank">Ice Dynamics and Palaeoclimate team</a>. I'm also a Postdoctoral By-Fellow at Churchill College. 
  
  Prior to that, I was a Research Associate in the same Department funded by the EPSRC <a href="https://iconicmath.org/" target="_blank">ICONIC</a> grant. I completed my doctoral degree at the University of Bath, UK in 2020 working on Gaussian processes. During my doctoral studies, I spent 3 years in industry as a Research Engineer at the Frostbite Physics Team at Electronic Arts, Guildford, UK. I hold an MMath degree from Durham University, UK.

My current research focuses on the following themes, particularly with application to large scale physical models in climate science:

<ul>
  <li>Computational aspects of Bayesian inverse problems</li>
  <li>Statistical understanding of Bayesian inverse problems</li>
  <li>Optimal design of experiments</li>
</ul>
